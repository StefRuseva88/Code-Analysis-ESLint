## This is a test project for Back-End Test Automation March 2024 Course @ SoftUni
This repository demonstrates the use of ESLint, a popular static code analysis tool for JavaScrip.
---

### Project Purpose:

This project showcases how to integrate ESLint into a development workflow to identify and fix potential issues in JavaScript code, improving code quality and maintainability.

### ESLint Overview:

ESLint is a static code analysis tool that analyzes your JavaScript code without actually running it. It can help you catch errors, enforce coding standards, and improve code readability.
### Getting Started

This project serves as an example and might not include a full-fledged JavaScript application. However, it  demonstrates how to configure ESLint for your project.

### Setup:

- Clone this repository.
- (Optional) Install any required dependencies if a sample project is included.
- Review the ESLint configuration file (usually .eslintrc.js or .eslintrc.json).
### Using ESLint:

The specific instructions for running ESLint will depend on your project setup. Here are some common approaches:

- Command Line: You can install ESLint globally and run it from the command line using the eslint command followed by the path to your JavaScript files.
- Code Editor Integration: Many popular code editors offer plugins or extensions for ESLint integration. These integrations can provide real-time feedback on potential issues as you write your code.
### Benefits of ESLint:

Improves code quality and consistency.
Reduces errors and bugs.
Enforces coding standards for better maintainability.
Helps write cleaner and more readable JavaScript code.
### Additional Notes:

- This repository demonstrates ESLint configuration and usage with the Script.js application file.
- The specific ESLint rules and configurations can be customized based on your project's requirements.
